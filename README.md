# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana use JavaScript to analyze UFO citings that occurred in a variety of cities and states. Given the data.js file, our objective was to use JavaScript to create a table with the information provided with the ability to filter the table based on certain criteria. In this challenge, we were able to create multiple filters for our table and display it through a browser using HTML. 

### Resources
- Data: data.js
- HTML: index.html
- JavaScript: app.js


## Results:

As we can see, the final product creates a functionally dynamic display for our table and allows users to filter based on date, city, state, country, and shape. You can use any of the filters by typing your desired search criteria (following the same format as the placeholders) and hitting enter. Deleting the search criteria and hitting enter as well as clicking the home button "UFO Citings" at the top conveniently clears the current search data and resets current filters. The filters can help with deeper analysis into UFO citings based on the criteria in the table.



## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
While this HTML creates a functionally dynamic display for our table, the design could be edited even further to set the filters as a drop down menu. It could become frustrating for users if they continuously try to filter data that is not present in the table. It could also be beneficial to include additional visual graphics such as graphs or maps to allow the user to visualize the data at their convenience.
